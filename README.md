# Lavaplayer Natives
This is a repository for storing lavaplayer natives. It is only used by Mod-Sauce and meant for the [IamMusicPlayer](https://github.com/Mod-Sauce/IamMusicPlayer_FIX) Minecraft mod.
The natives are stored in the `lavaplayer/natives` folder. The folder name is the version of the natives. The natives are stored in the `natives/{os}-{arch}` folder. 
The `os` is the operating system and the `arch` is the architecture. 
The natives are stored in the `natives/{os}-{arch}.zip` file.
The `natives_link.json` file is used to store the hash, url and version of the natives.
The Hashes are MD5 hashes.
